      <description>This tool helps in searching images similar to the posted image. Features are extracted from the image database and stored in order to use for searching. For feature extraction transfer learning approach is used to utilize a VGG16 model with weights pretrained on imagenet dataset. A flask web-interface is used to send the query image. The server returns top 10 similar images with score. This score represents how close the query image is to the result image.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project is to predict bitcoin price using deep learning models. This project contains three jupyter notebooks which involve machine learning steps like data preparation, model creation, training data, evaluation and optimization.
 Data_preparation.ipynb: In this notebook the dataset file bitcoin_historical_prices.csv is prepared in order to use by LSTM model. It also involve some exploratory data analysis. Training_and_prediction_using_LSTM.ipynb: In this notebook a single layer LSTM model is created, trained and evaluated.</description>

      <description>In this project a word2vec model is used to perform sentiment analysis for film reviews from the imdb data set. The dataset contains 75,000 training reviews and 25,000 test reviews. Word2vec&amp;rsquo;s performance was measured similar to the bag-of-word model because of the smaller dataset.
